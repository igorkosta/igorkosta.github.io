What does the word `STARTUP` mean to you?

If you would pick one word to describe it - what would this word be?

Having worked with the startups for the past 15 years, the one word that
describes the statup to me is - `UNCERTAINTY`.

It doesn't matter what your intentions are. The first and last thing you will
encounter on your startup jorney will be the uncertainty.

### Uniqueness
`Most ideas are not unique.` Even if you think your idea is one of its kind, there are probably thousands of people on the planet who have the same idea, hundreds of them are already trying to execute it, tens of them already failed and are working on something else.

It means that trying to implement an idea similar to yours, many teams already failed, partially due to the huge nebula of uncertainty, not enough grit or the wrong timing.

Even centuries ago when the world wasn't as connected as it is today, people in different parts of the world were working on the
same idea almost simultaneously - see [Who Invented Radio](https://spectrum.ieee.org/who-invented-radio-guglielmo-marconi-or-aleksandr-popov).

Nowadays it's rather impossible to come up with something unique and even if
you do - ideas are worthless without the practical proof of its applicability
at this particular point in time (later see [Timing](#timing)).

Let's try to come up with some examples:
- [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/) is not the first company to build an electric car - [History of the
  electric car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_electric_vehicle)
- [Space X](https://www.spacex.com/) is not the first space enterprise that came with an idea of reusable
  rockets - [Reusable spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_spacecraft)

Timing is an integral part for the success of your product.
