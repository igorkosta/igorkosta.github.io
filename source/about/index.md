I'm a <span class="highlight">Product and Tech Lead</span> living in Munich.

I have more than a decade of professional experience building and launching products for web, mobile and desktop.

I was responsible for launching the first version of the most used banking software on the German market: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/starmoney-financemanagement/id1237596145" target="_blank">StarMoney</a> for the Mac OS platform.

I <span class="highlight">led the development of worldwide first Open Banking API</span> at <a href="https://www.fidor.com/solutions/developer" target="_blank">Fidor Bank</a>. I managed two teams responsible for the Banking API and the Banking App Store.

I currently <span class="highlight">lead the product and software development</span> of the Cloud Banking Platform at <a href="https://mbanq.com/cloud" target="_blank">Mbanq</a> where we build an easy to customize Digital Banking Platform that can be rolled out in hours.

As an Interim CTO I helped to build the first version of <a href="https://www.cometum.com" target="_blank">Cometum</a> - the Investment Platform for the new generation.

<span class="highlight"><a href="https://www.serverless.com/" target="_blank">Serverless</a> is the stack of my choice</span> at the moment. Check out the <span class="highlight">Open Source</span> section for some of the goodies for the development of the serverless applications.

I'm running <a href="https://shows.acast.com/salty-breeze-radio/episodes" target="_blank">Salty Breeze Radio</a> - a weekly music podcast and writing <a href="https://ryan-raiz.github.io/avanti/" target="_blank">Avanti</a> - a fictional book about real life.
