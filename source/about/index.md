I'm a <span class="important">Product and Tech Lead</span> living in Munich.

I have more than a decade of professional experience building and launching digital products.

I was responsible for launching the first version of the most used banking software on the German market: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/starmoney-financemanagement/id1237596145" target="_blank">StarMoney</a> for the Mac OS platform.

I <span class="important">led the development of worldwide first Open Banking API</span> at <a href="https://www.fidor.com/solutions/developer" target="_blank">Fidor Bank</a>. I managed two teams responsible for the Banking API and the Banking App Store.

I currently <span class="important">lead the product and software development</span> of the Cloud Banking Platform at <a href="https://mbanq.com/cloud" target="_blank">Mbanq</a> where we build an easy to customize Digital Banking Platform that can be rolled out in hours.

As an Interim CTO I helped to build the first version of <a href="https://www.cometum.com" target="_blank">Cometum</a> - the Investment Platform for the new generation.

I established and led <a href="https://labs.mbanq.io" target="_blank">Mbanq Labs</a> - Singapore based FinTech accelerator.

<span class="important"><a href="https://www.serverless.com/" target="_blank">Serverless</a> is the stack of my choice</span> at the moment. Check out the <span class="important">Open Source</span> section for some of the goodies for the development of the serverless applications.
