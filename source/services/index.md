I'm offering services to startups and individuals.

If you are just starting to build your own company or if you're trying to scale
an established business and need any help - drop me a line.

Here are some of the services I provide:
-  `Pitch Deck Review` - whether you want to raise funds or get accepted
   into an accelerator - your pitch deck is your `window-shop` - the most
important artifact in the early stage of your startup. I helped a lot of
startups to prepare their pitch decks for the investors. If you would like your
pitch deck to be reviewed - <a href="mailto:igor@kostyuchenok.com?subject=Pitch Deck Review" target="_blank">drop me a line</a>
- `Product Review` - software is one of the few industries where you can create
  a product 100 times better than anything else currently on the market.
Creating a product customers will love is a hard work. If you need help with
that - <a href="mailto:igor@kostyuchenok.com?subject=Product Review" target="_blank">let's talk</a>
- `Interim CTO` - if you need help building an MVP or if you are planning to
  find/hire a CTO - <a href="mailto:igor@kostyuchenok.com?subject=Interim CTO">I may be able to help</a>

You can also book me to talk at your event or a conference. Topics I give talks about include:
- How to assemble a kick-ass team
- How to build successful products
- How to sell useless products :)
