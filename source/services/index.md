Having `more than 15 years of experience` working in and with startups both as
`founder, advisor and mentor`, I helped `more than 20 startups` to build their
products, define their vision and raise funds.

If you are just starting to build your own company or if you're trying to scale
an established business and need any help - drop me a line.

Here are some of the services I provide:
-  `Pitch Deck Review` - whether you want to raise funds or get accepted
   into an accelerator - your pitch deck is your `window-shop` - the most
important artifact in the early stage of your startup. I helped a lot of
startups to prepare their pitch decks for the investors. If you would like your
pitch deck to be reviewed - <a href="mailto:igor@kostyuchenok.com?subject=Pitch Deck Review" target="_blank">drop me a line</a>
- `Product Review` - software is one of the few industries where you can create
  a product 100 times better than anything else currently on the market.
Creating a product customers will love is a hard work. If you need help with
that - <a href="mailto:igor@kostyuchenok.com?subject=Product Review" target="_blank">let's talk</a>
- `Interim CTO` - if you need help building an MVP or if you are planning to
  find/hire a CTO - <a href="mailto:igor@kostyuchenok.com?subject=Interim CTO">I may be able to help</a>
