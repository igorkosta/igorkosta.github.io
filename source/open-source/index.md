Most of the stuff you build nowadays is only possible because of the people from the open source community.

I am also trying to give back to the community.

Some of my personal projects include:

[Shawerma](https://www.npmjs.com/package/shawerma) - a collection of helpers for working with serverless on AWS
[Funda](https://www.npmjs.com/package/funda) - an opinionated tool to create a Node.js serverless project
[Monod](https://www.npmjs.com/package/monod) - a CLI deployment helper for monorepo serverless project
[Log Dawg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/log-dawg) - push logs from your js frontend to AWS Cloudwatch
