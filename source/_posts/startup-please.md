Startups are hard. Successful startups are even harder. Don't let you tell otherwise. If it wasn't hard, everyone would be a successful entrepreneur.

All successful startups are product oriented. All successful products are customer oriented, even if the initial customer is the entrepreneur himself.

There is no product that's created in a vacuum. You will always have competition. The competition will be fierceful. If you want to truly make it, you have to be at the very top. Only a monopoly doesn't compete - don't let you tell otherwise.

All product related things aside - startups are all about grit. If you decided to build your own product and to dedicate your life to it - expect a bumpy ride. It will be probably the best decision of your life but only if you will have the right attitude.

I hope this book will help you to avoid some obstacles on your way to success. It doesn't represent the absolute truth, it just gives you some insights that I would love to know before embarking on a startup journey. I will keep it short, I promise - I know you won't have a lot of free time on your hands. I also won't get very deep into the startup matter. To paraphrase Leo Tolstoy:

> All happy startups resemble one another, but each unhappy startup is unhappy in its own way

Ok, let's not waste any more time and concentrate on the topics that will hopefully help you to create a `happy` and successful startup - to infinity and beyond!!!

# On A Side-note
I would like to thank everyone at Mbanq. Without the team that was carefully assembled by Mbanq's CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lounegov" target="_blank">Vlad Lounegov</a> - I wouldn't be able to truly experience the startup life and share with you any insights.

- Ideas are worth nothing without execution
- Your customers do not care about your tech
- Startup is a marathon not a sprint - pace yourself
- Timing matters but you cannot control it
- You don't know how your product will be used
- It will be harder than you think
