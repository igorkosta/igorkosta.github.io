The first step to overcome our brain's intention to self sabotage important decisions is to embrace the reality. There are three aspects of the reality that no one can avoid. Those three aspects are:
- Pain - no matter what you do in life, no matter how good your intentions are - the pain is inevitable
- Uncertainty - even if you try to thoroughly plan every step you take and every thought you think, there will always be stuff out of your control. It will have an impact on you - either positive or negative but you won't be able to control it
- Constant Work - work on yourself never stops. Whenever you think you are it means you start going backwards

So, what is the origin of `self sabotage`. We humans have been living in a rather safe environment for the last couple of hundreds of years. Before that for thousands of year we lived in a state of constant danger, which lead to our brain developing the protection mechanism against everything that it sees as a danger.

Although the intentional idea has been very good and helped us to survive all this thousands of years as a species, we need to overcome this protection whenever we have to develop a new habit. See the `self sabotage` as your `comfort zone` that actively holds you back from any changes - negative or positive ones.

`Self sabotage` is coming from the primal part of our brains and cannot be avoided. There is no known way to switch it off, whenever there will be uncertainty there will be self-doubt. The greater the uncertainty and adversity the bigger the opportunity and the more your brain will try to sabotage it.

If you can learn to overcome your fears, it will change your life.
