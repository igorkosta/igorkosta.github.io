The first step to overcome our brain's intention to self sabotage important decisions is to embrace the reality. There are three aspects of the reality that no one can avoid. Those three aspects are:
- Pain - no matter what you do in life, no matter how good your intentions are - the pain is inevitable
- Uncertainty - even if you try to thoroughly plan every step you take and every thought you think, there will always be stuff out of your control. It will have an impact on you - either positive or negative but you won't be able to control it
- Constant Work - work on yourself never stops. Whenever you think you are it means you start going backwards

So, what is the origin of `self sabotage`. We humans have been living in a rather safe environment for the last couple of hundreds of years. Before that for thousands of year we lived in a state of constant danger, which lead to our brain developing the protection mechanism against everything that it sees as a danger.

Although the intentional idea has been very good and helped us to survive all this thousands of years as a species, we need to overcome this protection whenever we have to develop a new habit. See the `self sabotage` as your `comfort zone` that actively holds you back from any changes - negative or positive ones.

`Self sabotage` is coming from the primal part of our brains and cannot be avoided. There is no known way to switch it off, whenever there will be uncertainty there will be self-doubt. The greater the uncertainty and adversity the bigger the opportunity and the more your brain will try to sabotage it.

If you can learn to overcome your fears, it will change your life. Let's examine some of the tools that can be helpful in overcoming `self sabotage`.

The shame and embarrassment is the glue that holds the humanity together. We were created to make mistakes. Making mistakes is the only way to accomplishing anything in life.

# The Tools
The Tools are a set of exercises that can help you to turn an unpleasant experience into an opportunity.

## String of Pearls
Don't devalue the small steps you're taking. Even the smallest ones. Doing every small thing the best as you can, will definitely yield results.

Imagine your life as a string of pearls. Every pearl is one action. Every action has the same value.It doesn't matter where an action is a failure or a success - the most important thing is to keep going and put the next pearl on the string.

You got out of bed - you just put a pearl on your string. You brushed your teeth - boom - next pearl is on the string. You wrote one sentence of your new book - there is your next pearl etc. etc.

As we already learned `uncertainty` is one of the three aspects of reality we cannot avoid. The winner is someone, who keeps putting pearls on his string ignoring the uncertainty and pain.

> The true confidence is living in uncertainty and moving forward. -- Dr. Phil Stutz

Every pearl on the string will have an imperfection inside and that's ok. Perfection kills productivity and can even kill the best intentions. Do the best you can right now and keep going.

## The Shadow
The Shadow represents the part of yourself you're ashamed of - the time when you were fat or the time when you were skinny, the time when you chickened out or the time when you were extremely indecisive. But all these times in the past it was also you. This part of you won't to be recognized as well.

As long as you will try to avoid confronting your past, imperfect self - you won't be at peace with it and it will appear at the most inconvenient times and block you again. Recognize yourself, be at peace with yourself and the next decision you must make will fall easier.
