As part of my mentoring activity I am often being asked questions regarding software development, talent growth, team management and more.

I would like to share my thoughts on some of the questions I was confronted with. It may help some of the followers of my writing.

- Should you train the best developers to get better or should you train the mediocre to get better?
  - ‚ÄúA team is only as strong as its weakest link‚Äù -- Mark Grey
  - If you can afford to train both the best and the weakest - train both
  - You could train the best to get even better and let them train the weak ones to get into their best shape
  - Not every good developer is a good trainer/coach/mentor
  - If you don‚Äôt train the weak links, they will fall behind even more and since A-Players want to work with A-Players, you will have hard time to grow talent internally
- Why do you put the best developers as team leads and lose them where they are most valuable? Who could do the lead work instead?
  - Let's get it out of the way: `Not every good developer is a good team leadi`
  - Who should lead your team depends on what ‚Äúleading‚Äù exactly means in your team/company
    - Leading the team technically
        - By teaching the team members about the technical quirks of the product?
        - By teaching the team the best practices of software development and helping them grow professionally (growing talent)?
        - All of the above and more...
    - Leading the team generally
        - By shielding the team from the board/VPs/C-Level to let them work on the product improvements?
        - By leading talks about team setup, team empowerment, team growth?
        - By conducting interviews, finding and hiring new team members etc.?
        - All of the above and more...
  - So, depending on what ‚Äúleading‚Äù means in your setup, you could designate different people for the team lead role
    - If you look for someone who should spread the knowledge about your architecture, you may choose the first person in the team
    - If you look for someone who should spread the knowledge about software architecture and design patterns in general, you may choose the best software developer on the team
    - If you look for someone who should help growing the talent on your team, you may choose someone who‚Äôs the best in identifying weak spots of a person and target them so that they can improve
  - I guess you promote the best developers to the team lead positions because it‚Äôs an obvious choice. You don‚Äôt have to think about the exact problem you‚Äôre trying to solve.
- Estimations are a huge topic in software development, what is your estimations strategy? Which techniques work best in your setup?
  - There should be NO ESTIMATIONS in man-hours - that‚Äôs just ridiculous üôÇ
  - Story points may work for a newly assembled team that doesn‚Äôt know its velocity yet
  - Story points are not for the  management but for the team. Once management starts converting them into man-hours - you can STOP using them
  - What worked best for us is - not doing any story points based estimations. When the team works long enough together - they can pick up the work for the next sprint without putting any points on a story
