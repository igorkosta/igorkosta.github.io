Startups are all about the speed of execution and iteration. If you don't have enough financial resources to hire a team to execute on your idea 24/7 for the next 3-6 months, your best bet is to find like-minded people and start working on your pitch-deck.

<!-- more -->

The goal of the pitch-deck is not to have a step-by-step plan for your
product/company for the next 12 months but rather to show a potential investor that you thought about:
- **product/market fit**
- **your market** - more often than not you'll start in a certain location and will later expand your product to the bigger market
- **growth potential** - how and where are you plannign to grow
- **competition** - who's your competitors and how your product is different/better
- **funding amount** - you should know how much funding you need and what you will spend it on

It's not about you having a detailed execution plan, cause that would be
a waste of time. Once you start executing, you will see how rapid your plan is changing.

Your pitch-deck should show that you're able to plan for short- and mid-term, analyze the current situation and build your product without completely losing your product vision.

Do not see your pitch-deck as `a means to an end` but rather as en exercisethat you will have to do every couple of months to review your product and its position on the market.

Don't forget that there's no formula for success - there's just a formula for failure.
