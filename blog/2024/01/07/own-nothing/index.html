Why, all of a sudden, we should stop owning anything although it is against our nature. Why is this narrative being pushed upon us so vigorously by the people that are owning almost everything? Let’s find out.</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>Just 60-70 years ago, owning a home, a couple of cars and a business was a dream of at least 90% of the people. And that’s not a surprise really. Since forever people have been trying to get independent by building its wealth and getting a certain societal status.</p>
<p>We, people, are social animals and the status game is one of the few games that’s hard-coded in us. We’ve been playing it since tribal times and we’ve been loving it. It’s not a surprise, since we’re wired for hierarchy and the status game.</p>
<p>How did it come to be that many people have bought into the <code>own nothing</code> narrative, assuming it’s actually against people’s nature?</p>
<p>Let’s analyze who’s interested in the majority that does neither own a car nor a house. Whoever will rent both of those properties out to you - your landlord or a car rental company. Despite the fact that the idea is sold to you as being liberating it is actually limiting. You may think you have all the choices in the world - live anywhere you like and drive any car you want but it could also mean - <code>you can only live where you&#39;re allowed to or only drive a car that is rented out to you</code> and both those choices are not necessarily your decisions. You landlord decides whether you will be able to rent a house of a flat and the car owner will decide, whether you will be allowed to drive a rental.</p>
<p>On top of that you’re getting accustomed to letting go of any of your possessions. It teaches you not to protect what’s yours and be <code>ok</code> with what you already have (which is not too bad in first approximation and sounds rather stoic) but it also teaches you not to strive for anything, lower your expectations and just become more obedient than you already are.</p>
<p>Without owning anything you can end up on the street very easily - you’re unprotected. If a rental company or an individual want to block you from renting their stuff - they can and you cannot do anything about it - you don’t own it.</p>
<p>If you have already bought into the idea of owning nothing, you’re already being controlled. Someone incepted this idea into your mind against your will, against the human nature.</p>
<p>Always remember that people who are convincing you to get rid of all of your possessions are the ones who own multiple real estates, multiple cars and will gladly rent them out to you as long as you don’t misbehave.</p>
<p>If you have bought into this story telling, here is your 3 step plan for you to become a perfect citizen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Own nothing</li>
<li>Decide nothing</li>
<li>Be nothing</li>
</ul>
