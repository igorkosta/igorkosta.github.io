<p>I would like to share my thoughts on some of the questions I was confronted with. It may help some of the followers of my writing.</p>

<ul>
<li>Should you train the best developers to get better or should you train the mediocre to get better?<ul>
<li>‚ÄúA team is only as strong as its weakest link‚Äù ‚Äì Mark Grey</li>
<li>If you can afford to train both the best and the weakest - train both</li>
<li>You could train the best to get even better and let them train the weak ones to get into their best shape</li>
<li>Not every good developer is a good trainer/coach/mentor</li>
<li>If you don‚Äôt train the weak links, they will fall behind even more and since A-Players want to work with A-Players, you will have hard time to grow talent internally</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why do you put the best developers as team leads and lose them where they are most valuable? Who could do the lead work instead?<ul>
<li>Let‚Äôs get it out of the way: <code>Not every good developer is a good team leadi</code></li>
<li>Who should lead your team depends on what ‚Äúleading‚Äù exactly means in your team/company<ul>
<li>Leading the team technically<ul>
<li>By teaching the team members about the technical quirks of the product?</li>
<li>By teaching the team the best practices of software development and helping them grow professionally (growing talent)?</li>
<li>All of the above and more‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Leading the team generally<ul>
<li>By shielding the team from the board/VPs/C-Level to let them work on the product improvements?</li>
<li>By leading talks about team setup, team empowerment, team growth?</li>
<li>By conducting interviews, finding and hiring new team members etc.?</li>
<li>All of the above and more‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So, depending on what ‚Äúleading‚Äù means in your setup, you could designate different people for the team lead role<ul>
<li>If you look for someone who should spread the knowledge about your architecture, you may choose the first person in the team</li>
<li>If you look for someone who should spread the knowledge about software architecture and design patterns in general, you may choose the best software developer on the team</li>
<li>If you look for someone who should help growing the talent on your team, you may choose someone who‚Äôs the best in identifying weak spots of a person and target them so that they can improve</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I guess you promote the best developers to the team lead positions because it‚Äôs an obvious choice. You don‚Äôt have to think about the exact problem you‚Äôre trying to solve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Estimations are a huge topic in software development, what is your estimations strategy? Which techniques work best in your setup?<ul>
<li>There should be NO ESTIMATIONS in man-hours - that‚Äôs just ridiculous üôÇ</li>
<li>Story points may work for a newly assembled team that doesn‚Äôt know its velocity yet</li>
<li>Story points are not for the  management but for the team. Once management starts converting them into man-hours - you can STOP using them</li>
<li>What worked best for us is - not doing any story points based estimations. When the team works long enough together - they can pick up the work for the next sprint without putting any points on a story</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
