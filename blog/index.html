<p>The first step to overcome our brain’s intention to self sabotage important decisions is to embrace the reality. There are three aspects of the reality that no one can avoid. Those three aspects are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pain - no matter what you do in life, no matter how good your intentions are - the pain is inevitable</li>
<li>Uncertainty - even if you try to thoroughly plan every step you take and every thought you think, there will always be stuff out of your control. It will have an impact on you - either positive or negative but you won’t be able to control it</li>
<li>Constant Work - work on yourself never stops. Whenever you think you are it means you start going backwards</li>

<p>Each man had only one genuine vocation - to find the way to himself….His task was to discover his own destiny - not an arbitrary one - and to live it out wholly and resolutely within himself. Everything else was only a would-be existence, an attempt at evasion, a flight back to the ideals of the masses, conformity and fear of one’s own inwardness.<br>― Herman Hesse</p>
