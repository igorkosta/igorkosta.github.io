<p>Let’s see why it is so hard to leave the poverty land and acquire the rich people mentality.</p>
<p>To fully understand the problem, let’s illustrate the differences between a person being born into a wealthy family versus a person being born into a regular one.</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>Being born into a wealthy family comes with a lot of perks. From the very childhood you have the access to the best possible education. As a child you will have a private tutor teaching you different language and giving you history and geography lessons, so once you reach the school age you will already have a superior view on the world, as the normal kids.</p>
<p>Once you reach the school age, you will attend the best possible private educational institution with other smart and reach kids, making valuable connections from the very early age. Even if you are not very smart or if you are lazy, by finishing the school you will have built up a great network of high network individuals and future company executives and political leaders.</p>
<p>After you finished your school, you will attend one of the best universities in the world and will continue extending your network and once you will get out of the door of your high profile educational facility you are set for the rest of your life - you have the most extended connection grid consisting of your schoolmates, university mates and their parents. You will automatically land a high-paying job without the need of having any experience or the need to prove that you are worth of it.</p>
<p>In contrary to that, if you were born in a regular family, at the end of your school you will have received a mediocre education and surrounded yourself mainly with regular people. Only 5% of them will achieve anything in their lifetime. You are automatically excluded from the network of power and wealth.</p>
<p>You will attend a regular university, earning a mediocre degree and struggling to get a job because you won’t have received any valuable experience during your studies. Once you will land a job in a bigger company or a large corporation, you will start wondering: <code>why don&#39;t many of your bosses understand the business they are in and why they are never responsible for the mistakes they make</code>.</p>
<p>It’s a regular practice to not fire a CEO even if she made a huge mistake that caused a company huge losses. Most of the time the responsibility is pushed on to the higher management with the explanation <code>they weren&#39;t able to execute the orders of the CEO/CTO/CFO etc.</code>. Even in an unlikely event of the head of the company being fired, she will be immediately offered a new high paying position at another high profile company.</p>
<p>Having the largest network of high network individuals, a rich person will be offered a lot of luxury goods for free. As a regular person, you will look up to a successful person. You will try to copy her way of life thinking that by owning luxury things, you will be part of the network but don’t kid yourself you never will.</p>
<p>Even if you have reached high status and became truly wealthy, you will always be looked down upon by a person being born into a rich family.</p>
