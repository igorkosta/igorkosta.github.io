Build it and they will come - never works.<br>You will have to do marketing for your product or service.</p>
<p>If you want to successfully sell your product or service, you should sell a story.</p>

<p>People are egocentric, social creatures who value their status in society. Every product that contributes to their value will get high attention. This way products can move from being used to solving problems to becoming status symbols: <code>Rolex</code>, <code>iPhone</code>, <code>Tesla</code>. The products that moved into the <code>status symbol</code> category will yield the highest earnings for the product provider.</p>
<p>It’s not the only <code>status symbol</code> category that needs to sell a story though. Ultimately every product should. You don’t sell flight tickets - you sell freedom to travel. You don’t sell the possibility to book an apartment or a hotel, you sell the dream of being local in a new place or to live a luxurious life for 3 days a year etc. etc.</p>
<p>If you think this pattern is only applicable for the consumer products, you are wrong. Absolutely the same is true for the <code>B2B</code> sector. Every company wants to be better than its competitors and they are ready to pay the premium price if you will sell your product the right way.</p>
<p>In order to sell your product, you have to truly know your customer and push the right buttons</p>
<p>Build up a loyal community of early adopters - people who trust you, will do the early tests of your product and give you an honest feedback you can use to improve your product or service. Offer your early adopters community special deals on you products or services - nurture and engage with your community.</p>
<p>Selling a product is as important as building it. You not only have to sell your product to your customers but you often you have to sell it to your investor as well. Thus your <code>Head of Sales</code> has to both know your product in and out and believe in your idea and support it fully.</p>
<h1 id="Gist"><a href="#Gist" class="headerlink" title="Gist"></a>Gist</h1><ul>
<li>You sell a story not a product or service</li>
<li>Product as a status symbol will yield more revenue</li>
<li>Build a loyal customer community. They will help you to grow your customer base (see <code>Apple</code>, <code>Tesla</code>)</li>
<li>Learn to sell your idea both to your customers and your investors</li>
</ul>
