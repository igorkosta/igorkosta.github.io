              Since the sandbox application took a center stage in this talk, we will inspect how Sandbox is connected with<br/>
              these applications and what it depends on. We'll take a look at the current dependencies<br/>
              that we might need to remove for you in order to use just the sandbox application.<br/>
              Afterwards we'll try to imagine possible scenarios for the students to use the sandbox<br/>
              That's where I will need you help since you're the ones who know the best what you students need<br/>

              At the very end I will present you a possible Semester Plan for the API oriented course.

              First of all - what you have to understand: whatever we've built so far, we  build for our own use case<br/>
              It means - it won't necessarily cover the use case you have in mind. That's why we gathered here, to see how<br/>
              we can improve our product line so that it covers the use case you have and also contributes to our strategy.<br/>

              All applications are interconnected - some of them more than the others<br/>
              That is one of the reasons why we have to understand together with you, what is your goal, so that we can<br/>
              deliver the best possible product or product set for you.<br/>

              Since the <strong>sandbox application</strong> took a center stage for this talk, sandbox is the first on the list<br/>
              although it's by far the smallest application from the bunch<br/>

              <strong>Application Manager</strong> or how we call it internally APM is used by 3rd party developers to manage their access to Fidor API<br/>

              <strong>Banking</strong> - main application of the stack. It holds the most functionality - which is both a blessing and a curse :)<br/>

              <strong>Backoffice</strong> - primarily used by Customer Service to perform different backoffice actions.<br/>

              <strong>Community</strong> - you probably already heard a lot about how great the Fidor community is.<br/>
              So, I won't get into any details on this one.

            <aside class="notes">
              Let's start with the basic application flows to identify how are the applications interconnected<br/>
              Before you can start developing and testing your app against the sandbox you have to login into the Appication Manager.<br/>
              APM allows 3rd party developers to manage the access to the fidor API and build and test their Apps against the sandbox.
            </aside>
          </section>

          <!-- create app -->
          <section>
            <h2>Create an App</h2>
          </section>
          <section>
            <img height="700" src="img/sp/SP_App.png" style="padding-top: 5px;"/>
            <aside class="notes">
              From the your apps list page you can create a new app<br/>
              By doing so, you have to provide some mandatory information that will be used afterwards to for example, prevent<br/>
              malicious apps to access your API account. First of all, whenever you want to acquire a new API token for yourself<br/>
              of for on of the users who use your app, you have to provide us with you client_id and client_secret.<br/>
              This way we will know that it's your app that wants to get access. Additionally to that we will check if the<br/>
              request is coming from one of the allowed_ip addresses and if the user will be redirected to the<br/>
              callback_url you provided.

              Whenever you create a new App a new sandbox is created and and associated with it.

            <aside class="notes">
              As you can see from Sandbox URL: it has its own OAuth implementation that behaves the same as the one<br/>
              in production environment so that the developers don't have to change the flow they implemented<br/>
              while using and testing their app against sandbox.

              Sandbox is filled with the dummy data and behaves as if it was a banking application. For the testing purpose<br/>
              alongside the basic account data some financially relevant data created as well: transactions, transfers,<br/> direct debits. The number of created transactions (and other data that you see on this slide is configurable<br/> on the application level).

              In case you have a team of developers (or should we say students :), who want to work on the same app in a team<br/>
              the owner of the app can invite them to participate. They will get an email and have to register (or login) to<br/> start working on the app.<br/>
              Once you're done with testing your app, you want to deploy it to production. Before the bank customers will<br/> see your app in the app store and will be able to install and use it, it has to undergo the approval process.<br/>
              Send to approval/approve.<br/>
              <strong>It's the time where Backoffice comes in.</strong>

              Sandbox is used for the simulation of the banking account, with transfers and everyting that belongs to it<br/>
              Since we describe the functionality of our APIs with JSon Schemas, we're able to "fake" the data based on them<br/>
              JSon Schemas can also be used to validate the data.

              Fidor Schema - is used to describe the API functionality and create a basic structure for the API usage. It's<br/>
              packaged as a ruby gem (library) and used for tests in the banking application.<br/>
              Fidor ACL (Access Control List) - is used to enforce

          <aside class="notes">
            If you'd like to only use the sandbox applicaiton these are the dependencies that have to be removed first.<br/>
            Both fidor schema and fidor acl are specific to fidor's banking application, so we probably have to remove them<br/>
            before you can start use the sandbox.<br/>
            It means basically that we also have to introduce the permissions and roles concept into the sandbox as well.<br/>

              HTTP/2 leaves most of HTTP 1.1's high-level syntax, such as methods, status codes, header fields, and URIs, the same. The element that is modified is how the data is framed and transported between the client and the server.
              HTTP/2 - minification, server push<br/>
              SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol. It uses XML Information Set for its message format,<br/>
              and relies on application layer protocols, most often Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)<br/>
              or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), for message negotiation and transmission.<br/>
              REST - Representational state transfer<br/>
              WebRTC - (Web Real-Time Communications) <br/>
              Websockets <br/>
              There is one significant difference: Websockets works via TCP, WebRTC works via UDP. In fact, WebRTC is SRTP protocol with some addutional features like STUN, ICE, DTLS etc and internal VoIP features such as Adaptive Jitter Buffer, AEC, AGC etc.

              <strong>DDD</strong> = Domain-driven design is an approach to developing software for complex needs by deeply connecting the implementation to an evolving model of the core business concepts.<br/>
              <strong>Event Sourcing</strong> = (Immutable Data) The fundamental idea of Event Sourcing is that of ensuring every change to the state of an application is captured in an event object, and that these event objects are themselves stored in the sequence they were applied for the same lifetime as the application state itself.<br/>
              Why is it important for the banks - cause it's how the banks should work. They should be able to track back any<br/> change in the system, because they obliged to do so by law.<br/>
              <hr/>
              CQRS - command query responsibility segregation. It solves the problem of building the reporting queries for example<br/>
              cause with properly built event sourced system it's quite hard to generate them. Additionally to that<br/>
              it helps to segregate the concerns of writing to the system and reading from it.
