            Think Big: vision should give us place to pivot if needed.<br/>
            If we talk about "cashflow" for example, it could already limit us down.<br/>
            "Better know your company" - gives us more room to explore our opportunity.<br/>
            "Better Decisions with Predictive Analytics" - sounds about right. It's quite a precise one but still let us room to pivot if needed. Is it the current vision?

              <strong>New Markets:</strong> Different countries. Taking current financial situation into account - we could offer our solution to the airlines in Russia or other post soviet countries. The market is pretty big and companies from Europe enjoy good reputation.
              We could also explore the possibility to offer a product to broader audience by extending the product to support multiple tenants and let SMEs connect to it.<br/>

              <strong>New Industries:</strong> On your page you're giving a couple of examples, where your solution/product can be used: airlines, hospitality, financial industries. After extending the predictive analytics core we could make the product work for more/other industries.<br/>

              <strong>New Price Strategy:</strong> We have to explore different price strategies - BUT - price strategy goes hand-in-hand with the strategy we choose for the product.

              We could also explore the possibility to offer a product to broader audience by extending the product to support multiple tenants and let SMEs connect to it.
              We'll have to invest time and money though in making the product scalable and resilient, since having a lot of customers would also mean increase of load on the system (might be solved by scaling through hardware first) :)

              Since we have a small team, we have to make a decision what's our core competence.<br/>
              As long as we don't have a lot of customers, we still can handle the workload. Once we start getting more of them, we will have to either start grow significantly or reassess our competences.<br/>
              One of the possible solutions would be to concentrate MORE on the core prediction algorithm. Expand it to support different industries.

              Open up the API everyone can build apps on top - we provide the core community provides the special part for a certain industry

              We provide the prediction engines for different industries - community builds apps on top of our APIs. Revenue sharing or we get 40% same as apple or google.

              If we can build up a core that can be used for many different industries and build up a community and promote it, we have a chance to becoma a #1 Predictive Analytics Provider.
